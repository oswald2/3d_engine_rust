* 3D Engine

This is a Rust implementation of the tutorial series from javidx9 (see first video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih20l3pJoeU). The lessons are the commits in the history of this repository. The current final version is the mountain flying around.

Thanks a lot javidx9! You are amazing!

** Building

This uses the sdl2 crate for Rust, so =sdl2= as it's dependencies need to be installed. Then it is a simple matter of =cargo build --release=.

** Using

The following keys can be used:
 - =cursor up=: going up (height)
 - =cursor down=: going down
 - =a=: turn left
 - =d=: turn right
 - =w=: go forward
 - =s=: go backwards
